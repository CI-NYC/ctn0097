Using the CTN0097 data, these plots were created to visualize some trends regarding the doses of clonadine and clonazepam that were administered over a period of 12 visits.

The measures being visualized here are:
1. The number of doses given to a patient on each visit, by medication
2. The total strength of doses given to a patient on each visit, by medication
3. The maximum strength of a dose given to a patient on each visit, by medication

The patients in the data were assigned to one of two treatment arms, C or D. Separate plots were made for each treatment arm. 

The included plots are collections of histograms, where each histogram shows the distribution of the number of doses/total strength/maximum strength across patients for a given visit and medication. Visits 0 (baseline) to 11 are represented.

Notes and considerations:
1. For arm D, the range of visit numbers include 0-12. Visit 12 is not included in the plots because no doses were ever administered after visit 11.
2. However, for arm C, visit numbers go all the way up until visit 28. No doses were administered past visit 23.
3. The x-axes for the total_strength and max_strength plots are not fixed (scale of x-ticks can differ between histograms) because there are a small number of patients who received a very high dose strength on only a single day.
